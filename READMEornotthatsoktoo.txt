There are 3013 lines of code used in our project.

I worked on the title screen, manually placing the ships, checking to see who won, making animations, and making the game clickable
Pat worked on animations, displaying the board, durga mode, making the ships, placing them on the board, and the computers turn
We peer coded making the ships randomly appear without going out of bounds or over lapping and making sure the player can select which position to attack, we would then make sure to fix each others bugs

The only bug I know of is clicking outside of the valid area sometimes caused the computer to attack without the player making a move. I fixed this just before submitting by putting Call GetMouseCoords within a repeat block. Other than that there are no other known bugs.

# Battleship
The battleship program Pat and I had wrote for our Assembly class

I'm actually pretty proud of this one as it took a lot of time and a lot of lines of assembly to accomplish.

I just ran it today for the first time in almost 2 years and I was still impressed with how much I added to the game:

Ability to click,
Ability to choose where your ships go,
Collision detecting so your ships can't overlap,
And Durga Mode which is an auto win button we made in honor of our teacher

I also included the original READMEornotthatsoktoo file that I had submitted with the project because who actually does read README files?
